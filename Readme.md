This project uses the classic Iris dataset to train and evaluate a machine learning model. The goal is to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on four physical characteristics.

Dataset

- Name: Iris Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Description: The Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Features:
    - Sepal length (cm)
    - Sepal width (cm)
    - Petal length (cm)
    - Petal width (cm)
    - Species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica)

Project Structure

- data/: Contains the Iris dataset in CSV format.
- models/: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- src/: Contains the source code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
